# Indian Zero Carbon Energy Pathways (IDEEA) information page

## About
IDEEA is a collaborative open energy modeling initiative between [Environmental Defense Fund](www.edf.org), [Global Change Programme, Jadavpur University](http://juglobalchangeprogram.org/gcp/), and [Indian Institute of Science, Energy Transition Group](https://iisc.ac.in/) to develop tools and scenarios of India’s energy transition. The project aims evaluation a broad set of scenarios with high penetration of variable renewables and identify a set of most cost-efficient options of deep decarbonization and carbon neutrality for India for broad public discussion.  

## IDEEA models  
Decarbonization of electricity is a critical milestone of the energy transition to low/zero emissions. Wind and solar energy are the most sustainable options of decarbonization, and the recent reduction of costs makes them the first options to consider. However, the variability of the energy sources requires explicit modeling and evaluation of alternative balancing options, such as hydro energy, energy storage, grid, back-up capacity, and responsive demand. IDEEA project aims to develop a “new” or “renewables era” modeling framework for India to evaluate high-VER scenarios based on high temporal and spatial resolution.  

**The IDEEA model features (as of Mar 2021):**  
  *	1-hour resolution with the full year (8760 hours) optimization.  
  *	40-years hourly weather data (from NASA’s MERRA-2 project) with ~50x60 km spatial resolution is used to evaluate the reliability of high-renewables scenarios to alternative (historical) weather conditions.  
  *	Flexible time horizon (from one year for the most detailed representation of electric power system) to intertemporal optimization of transitional pathways.  
  *	State level models and 30-region national versions of the model.  
  *	Optimization of interregional (high-voltage HVDC or HVAC) electric power grid with converter stations.  
  *	Alternative groups of responsive demand technologies, including an intraday shift in consumption, optimization of location, power-to-X groups of technologies, exogenous or optimized load curve.  
  *	Optimization of energy storage (hourly and seasonal), including batteries and operation of hydropower plants.  
  
The detailed and flexible framework of the IDEEA model provides an opportunity to evaluate a broad range of decarbonization scenarios of the electric power sector and major energy-consuming industries and sectors.
